Priority: required
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: block device id library
 The blkid library which allows system programs like fsck and
 mount to quickly and easily find block devices by filesystem UUID and
 LABEL.  This allows system administrators to avoid specifying
 filesystems by hard-coded device names, but via a logical naming
 system instead.

Package: libuuid1
Section: libs
Depends: passwd, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: uuid-runtime
Replaces: e2fsprogs (<< 1.34-1)
Architecture: any
Description: Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.

Package: uuid-runtime
Section: libs
Priority: optional
Depends: passwd, libuuid1 (>> 1.40.3-1), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Replaces: e2fsprogs (<= 1.40.3-1ubuntu1)
Architecture: any
Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUID’s, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face
 of large numbers of threads trying to grab UUID’s running on
 different CPU’s. It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen
 program.
